# Decisions

Record significant decisions here: date, decision, why, alternatives considered.

## 2026-09-26 — Hosting: Vercel (serverless) + Firestore
Free, nothing to keep running, phone-browser access from anywhere. Browser-only
was rejected: Yahoo's API blocks browser (CORS) calls and the OAuth client
secret can't ship to a browser. Rejected: Firebase Cloud Functions (requires
paid Blaze plan), Render free tier (cold-start sleep), Fly.io (no free tier for
new accounts), self-hosting on the Mac (must stay awake).

## 2026-09-26 — Salaries via CSV import behind a SalarySource interface
Cap hits change rarely (signings, extensions). PuckPedia's API is private and
paid; scraping it conflicts with its terms. The interface leaves room for a
live source later.

## 2026-09-26 — Language: Python
Mature Yahoo Fantasy wrappers exist for Python (yfpy, yahoofantasy); the
Yahoo API is awkward enough that this saves real time.
