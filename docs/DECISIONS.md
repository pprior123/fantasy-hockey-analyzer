# Decisions

Record significant decisions here: date, decision, why, alternatives considered.

## 2026-09-26 — Hosting: Vercel (serverless) + Firestore
Free, nothing to keep running, phone-browser access from anywhere. Browser-only
was rejected: Yahoo's API blocks browser (CORS) calls and the OAuth client
secret can't ship to a browser. Rejected: Firebase Cloud Functions (requires
paid Blaze plan), Render free tier (cold-start sleep), Fly.io (no free tier for
new accounts), self-hosting on the Mac (must stay awake).

## 2026-09-26 — Salaries via CSV import behind a SalarySource interface
Cap hits change rarely (signings, extensions). PuckPedia's API is private and
paid; scraping it conflicts with its terms. The interface leaves room for a
live source later.

## 2026-09-26 — Language: Python
Mature Yahoo Fantasy wrappers exist for Python (yfpy, yahoofantasy); the
Yahoo API is awkward enough that this saves real time.

## 2026-09-26 — Test network guard: pytest-socket
All tests run with `--disable-socket --allow-unix-socket`, so any test that
opens an internet socket fails (CLAUDE.md hard rule 2) instead of relying on
review to catch it. Unix sockets stay allowed because asyncio's event loop
uses a socketpair. The Firestore-emulator integration tests (M3) will need a
targeted `--allow-hosts=127.0.0.1` opt-in. Alternative: respx's
`assert_all_mocked` only — rejected, it covers httpx but not other clients.

## 2026-09-26 — Per-package coverage gates via scripts/check_coverage.py
pytest-cov supports only a global `--cov-fail-under`. SPEC §9 requires
per-package gates on line *and* branch coverage, so a small script reads
`coverage.json` and checks each `fha` subpackage against
`[tool.fha.coverage-gates]` in pyproject.toml. Packages with no measurable
code are skipped; a package with code but no configured gate fails, so new
packages cannot escape the gates. Alternative: one `coverage report
--include=... --fail-under=N` call per package — rejected, it checks the
combined line+branch percentage and errors on packages with no data yet.

## 2026-09-26 — Build backend and dependency policy
`uv_build` backend, `src/` layout, Python pinned to 3.12 (`>=3.12,<3.13`).
Runtime dependencies are added in the milestone that needs them (none in M0),
and script-only tools such as `openpyxl` stay in the dev group so they never
reach the serverless bundle (cold starts, SPEC §2).

## 2026-09-26 — Domain purity is enforced by a test
`tests/unit/test_architecture.py` parses every module under `fha/domain/`
and fails on imports of I/O, network, clock (`datetime`, `time`), randomness
or the outer layers. Cheap, and it turns the "respect the seams" rule into a
gate.
